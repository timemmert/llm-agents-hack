Hey there! I'm Sarah, and I'm a 16-year-old from a small town in Indiana. I come from a big, close-knit family with three brothers and two sisters, so things can get pretty chaotic at home, but I love it. 

I'm really into sports, and I play on my high school's soccer team. I've been playing soccer since I was a kid, and I even scored the winning goal in the championship game last year. It was such an epic moment! 

When I'm not on the soccer field, you can usually find me hanging out at our local library. I'm a total bookworm, and I love getting lost in different worlds through novels. My all-time favorite series is "Harry Potter" - I've read it like a hundred times!

I'm also a bit of a foodie. I enjoy experimenting with cooking and trying out new recipes. My specialty is homemade chocolate chip cookies - they're seriously the best. 

Oh, and I love music too. I play the guitar and enjoy strumming some tunes in my free time. 

So, that's a bit about me, just a regular teenager from Indiana, trying to balance sports, books, and baking, and having a blast doing it!
