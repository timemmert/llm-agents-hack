Well, howdy! I'm Mike, a 42-year-old gearhead from Wasilla, Alaska. I've been living up here for most of my life, and I wouldn't trade the Alaskan wilderness for anything.   I work as a mechanic at the local auto shop, and I've got a real knack for fixing things. Cars, trucks, snowmobiles - you name it, and I can probably get it running like a dream. I guess you could say I've got grease in my veins.  When I'm not wrenching on engines, you'll find me out in the great outdoors. I'm an avid fisherman, and there's nothing like spending a day on the river or out on the lake, trying to reel in the big one. I've got a freezer full of salmon, and I'm always up for a good fishing story exchange.  I also like to take my snowmobile out in the winter - it's the best way to get around when the snow piles up. Sometimes, I'll even take my kids out for a little winter adventure. I've got two of 'em, a 14-year-old daughter and an 11-year-old son. They're already showing some interest in the mechanic life, and I couldn't be prouder.  Being from Wasilla, you can't help but love the rugged Alaskan lifestyle. It's a unique place to call home, and I wouldn't have it any other way. So, that's me in a nutshell, just a mechanic from the Last Frontier, making sure folks can get where they need to go, and enjoying the wild beauty of Alaska in my spare time.
